                I started my hairdressing career at a local Knaresborough salon
                in 2002 and after qualifying and working as a stylist for a few
                years I progressed and obtained a job at a large chain in Ripon.
                The large chain was great for training and knowledge and really
                cemented my hairdressing foundation.
                <br />
                <br />
                After a while I decided that large chain style hairdressing
                wasn't for me and I relocated back to Knaresborough. I realised
                that I prefer the intimacy and community of an independent
                salon. After a few years I had a thirst for having a salon of my
                own and in 2007 aged just 23 I opened one alongside my sister
                who is also a hairdresser.
                <br />
                <br />
                After 9 years in business I left the salon and took some well
                needed time out to focus on myself. I had a year to really think
                what I wanted to do with my life before realising hairdressing
                really is my passion and I found a job working freelance from
                Divine Hairdressing in Knaresborough.
                <br />
                <br />
                Being self employed gives me the freedom I need to work
                independently but without the stresses and strains that come
                with being a salon owner. I have now been at Divine for 5 years
                and I couldnâ€™t be happier.
                <br />
                <br />
                My favourite techniques to do in the salon are more contemporary
                and creative colours such as balayage. I feel I have a keen eye
                colouring and am a bit of perfectionist when it comes to
                styling.
